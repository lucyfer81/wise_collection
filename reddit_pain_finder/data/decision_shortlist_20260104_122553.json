      "target_users": "Corporate professionals, interns, or solo entrepreneurs who feel their personal life is being consumed by work, lack the energy for proactive journaling, and crave a simple, automated way to notice and remember small positive moments.",
      "missing_capability": "A simple, automated way to capture and reflect on small, meaningful personal moments outside of work to counteract the feeling that life has 'shrunk to just work,' especially for those in draining corporate or entrepreneurial environments.",
      "why_existing_fail": "Calendar and to-do apps are work-centric and add to the burden of planning. Mindfulness and therapy apps address symptoms but not the core problem of a life devoid of memorable non-work moments. Manual journaling or scrapbooking requires consistent energy and motivation, which exhausted professionals lack. Existing tools are either too generic, require proactive effort, or fail to create a tangible record of life beyond work.",

      "target_users": "Solo founders and indie developers shipping web apps who are terrified of breaking critical flows with weekly updates, currently wasting hours on manual testing or struggling with unsustainable test automation.",
      "missing_capability": "A lightweight, zero-maintenance tool that automatically generates and runs a minimal set of critical end-to-end tests after each code change, specifically for solo founders and small teams who cannot afford the time or complexity of traditional test automation.",
      "why_existing_fail": "Existing tools like Selenium and Playwright require significant setup, ongoing maintenance, and coding expertise, becoming a 'part-time job' to keep tests passing as the app evolves. They are too complex and time-consuming for solo founders or small teams who need to ship quickly. Manual checklists are error-prone and don't scale, while outsourcing test creation often fails due to misalignment and lack of ownership.",
