Events 1\u20136 involve diagnosing and fixing micro-level flaws in video structure using data-informed tweaks, with similar goals (boost retention, trigger rewatches, satisfy algorithms). Event 7 involves scaling data pipelines and faces technical infrastructure barriers, while Event 8 is about manual data import inefficiencies\u2014both are data workflow bottlenecks but in a completely different domain (data operations vs. content optimization). Thus, Events 1\u20136 form a coherent, highly similar workflow (rated 0.7\u20130.8 among themselves), but including Events 7 and 8 lowers the overall similarity to 0.7 due to partial overlap in 'diagnosing failure points with data' but divergent domains and actions. The core activity in 1\u20136 is creative content tuning; in 7\u20138, it's data handling.

The key difference is that Events 3 and 4 emphasize metacognitive effort (organizing systems), while Events 1 and 2 focus on execution of understanding\u2014but all stem from ineffective knowledge retention workflows. The workaround of switching apps (Events 3, 4) mirrors the adoption of Feynman (Events 1, 2) as a search for a 'better system' to fix shallow learning.
