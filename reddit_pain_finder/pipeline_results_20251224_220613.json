While these are technical rather than behavioral failures, they represent the same core workflow: dependence on AI for task execution \u2192 AI unreliability \u2192 manual workaround or tool substitution.

The root cause is consistent: existing systems fail to prioritize and escalate only critical messages effectively. The workarounds (disabling notifications, avoiding tools) reflect similar coping mechanisms. The minor variation is in the specific tools mentioned (email, Slack, generic notification systems), but the underlying workflow\u2014filtering and guaranteeing delivery of critical alerts\u2014is identical.
