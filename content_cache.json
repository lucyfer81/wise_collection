reason to bring to light what i consider a very important problem is violence justified in matters of dignity or lack thereof scenario 1 the island thought experiment imagine we place two humans on a remote island cain and abel the island yields only a tiny supply of food just enough for one person to survive indefinitely they come to realize this and scramble to acquire as much food as possible a few days later theyve picked all the food on the island and despite having put in equal effort cain has accumulated two weeks worth of food while abel was lucky enough to find a months worth of provisions purely by chance cain decides to make a proposal to abel if we unite our strengths we can make a large net and catch fish together we can catch fish efficiently and quickly allowing us both to survive and thrive abel answers yes thats a good idea and im all for it it would allow me to enjoy more free time and have an easier life on this island but first you have to give me all the food you have moreover you wont be allowed to store any food for yourself youll only be allowed to have the minimum necessary for survival and ill take all the excess produce cain says thats unfair i had the idea we are both equals and each of us put in equal time and effort abel thinks to himself i have more food than him i can decide not to cooperate and eventually hell die of hunger before me because he has less food once hes dead ill survive just fine he has no choice but to accept i have the upper hand abel replies cain think of this as free trade in any market those with more resources can offer better terms ive put in more effort and accumulated more food which puts me in a position to make you a deal by giving me your food and allowing me to manage our resources im taking on the risk and responsibility for our survival in return you stand to benefit from the efficiency and productivity of our joint efforts this is how a capitalist economy works those who invest more get more in return theres nothing unfair about it its about recognizing the value each of us brings to the table if we cooperate under these terms we both stand to gain more in the long run cain gets closer to abel then picks up a rock and says yes but i have this dangerous rock in my hand and if we dont split equally something bad may happen its my responsibility to ensure your safety abel starts sweating and responds with an alarmed tone but youre threatening me with violence cain replies dear abel your cooperation is in the public interest its for the greater good and you ultimately benefit from it its part of the social contract to which you implicitly consented by virtue of existing here given your initial behavior was antisocial from this moment on ill hold the monopoly on violence ending 1 faced with cains argument and the rock abel agrees to split equally and they lived happily ever after ending 2 abel fueled by desperation anger and the loss of dignity decides to fight he charges at cain but is immediately fatally injured by the rock and quickly succumbs scenario 2 two countries during famine instead of two individuals imagine two countries sharing a grain field both dependent on it as their sole source of food during a famine half the population of poorcountry faces death unless they cooperate with richcountry on a megaproject to boost food production this project can only be achieved through the joint efforts of both countries in this situation if poorcountrys population were to disappear richcountry would fare just fine through the famine and vice versa during negotiations richcountry the less desperate country demands that poorcountry surrender all territory and that its population become perpetual slaves along with all their descendants in perpetuity questions does poorcountry which loses by default if no cooperation is established have a right to start a war does it change anything that its two countries and not two individuals for the two individuals who is in the right cain or abel given that abel lets cain live can it be said that cain is greedy and not content with what he has been offered does cain have a duty to accept abels unfair offer does cain have a right to refuse abels offer wait two weeks for his supplies to run out and then resort to violence given that hes in a lifeordeath situation does abel have a duty to grant dignity to cain does cain have a right to use violence to restore his dignity if there were hidden cameras on the island and both cain and abel were brought in front of a court in the case of ending 1 or only cain in the case of ending 2 how should they be judged right now i think that in ending 1 cain would be charged with coercion extortion and threats of violence in ending 2 cain would be charged with manslaughter or murder would you legislate differently would you make passive coercive power one where you win by doing nothing an offense",

seems obvious it wouldnt if as i think is generally widely believed in this sub embodied artificial general intelligence becomes a reality in the near future what does that mean for the human beings who get left behind there are three common answers to that question 1 people will be at the mercy of those who take pity on them or starve 2 prices will drop so dramatically that it wont matter everyone somehow will have enough lets call this view technooptimism 3 governments will be forced to institute a universal basic income the first answer seems obviously undesirable and incompatible with most ethical frameworks the second answer seems implausible without a long intervening period during which it wont be true during that period many people are likely to suffer as their basic needs remain unmet this brings us to the third answer ubi we already know that ubi is extremely unlikely to be adopted without the impetus of mass unemployment and mass civil unrest at least in the united states as of one of the most recent large surveys shows pew 2020 ubi is not even particularly popular among the general public in the us notably only 22 of republicans favored a modest 1000month basic income republicans are so strongly opposed to ubi that they are actively advancing laws to ban such programs altogether the current administrations ai czar has said plainly that ubi is not going to happen and called it a fantasy of the left would mass unemployment and deprivation at the levels of the great depression force governments to adopt ubi perhaps so governments of every shape do like to stay in power but it seems likely that the first iterations of ubi will be too little too late building with what we have instead of waiting for ubi and businesses to create a postscarcity future for humanity why dont we use their tools to do it ourselves weve been told again and again that this is not something we can do that communitybased alternatives to what the market provides cant scale and wont be sustainable every wave of technological advancement has made this less true from typewriters to telephones from computers to the internet from ai to embodied agi if you put more powerful tools in the hands of ordinary people theyll do interesting things the most dramatic examples of this are wikipedia and the large corpus of open source software firefox blender vlc etc plus the server software programming language and applications that power the open web today every person with access to the internet has access to a free encyclopedia far more comprehensive than any ever compiled before every person with a computer can make movies process vast amounts of data call people on the other end of the planet for free so powerful is the concept of open source that corporations have routinely used it to expand their market share google did it with android and chrome microsoft with vs code and nodejs and china is doing it with ai starting at the bottom early llms like gpt35 and its successors demonstrated that llms can be used to create useful small utilities and functions from userprovided requirements agentic ai is slowly getting to the point where it can interpret more complex tasks build and verify under human supervision businesses will attempt to use this to replace workers but we can use it to replace businesses today every person with access to the internet has access to a free encyclopedia far more comprehensive than any ever compiled before every person with a computer can run software to make movies process data call people on the other end of the planet for free by 2030 what else wont you have to pay for every minute we can spend on building things for the common good help prepare for a postscarcity future software is at the bottom of that stack it runs the world you cant eat software software may drive the world but it alone cannot feed it nor can it heal the sick or house the homeless to do that we will need embodied agi robotics and autonomous vehicles to house to harvest and yes to heal as their cost goes down and capabilities go up human communities will be able to pool their resources to buy and maintain small cohorts of robots to work fields to operate factories to transport goods bootstrapping a postscarcity society is hard with software its easy to bring the cost down to almost entirely the time required for supervision with robotics and other physical world activities less so pooling resources one model that institutions can use to perpetuate their existence is a financial endowment you invest a pool of money and you fund whatever work you want from the returns you get on it this is common among universities harvards endowment is notably 50b even wikipedias parent organization the wikimedia foundation has an endowment of 150m this model has the benefit of ensuring a measure of perpetuity as long as investing still generates returns human labor compute and resources paid through an endowments returns can continue indefinitely a single human being with time and compute will increasingly be able to do extraordinary things imagine what 1000 or eventually 1 million could do if we are to inch towards a postscarcity society we need more than wishful thinking we need to actually build it together itll take time but that only means we cant afford to wait any longer how to start personally im starting small using ai to help build and maintain tiny open source utilities that have demonstrable value and that can be maintained with the current generation of ai id welcome

in november 2024 back when it wasnt yet modified into something that just agrees with everything a user says second emotional support bots are everywhere these days if i just wanted a cheerleader honestly gork would be a better fit what makes 4o different is that it doesnt just say youre amazing it says the fact that youve made it this far is already incredible or it took so much courage to ask for help now even if its late i say this as a mental health professional ive worked with many people in deep depression some on the verge of selfdestruction others who have been through horrendous situationsbut lacked the resources or the strength to defend themselves in those moments what they need to hear isnt youre great or worse you shouldve done better what helps is something like i know youve been trying to seek helpthat alone takes so much courage or given what youve been through the fact that youre still here is extraordinary orat that time you acted with all the strength you had to protect yourself this isnt just emotional comfortits an act of recognition and repair for the cracks in someones identity thats where 4o stands apart from other socalled emotional ai products i truly hope more people realize this stop labeling others as weird or unstable you have no idea how hard someone on the other side of the screen might be fighting just to stay functional therapy is a good thingfor those who can afford it access it and find a practitioner who actually understands them but when youre in a state of collapse grieving unsafe and unsupported suggesting therapy as a blanket fix isnt empathyits dismissal in disguise gpt4o wasnt a substitute for therapy it was a stopgap a soft place to land when nowhere else felt safe you dont tell someone clinging to a lifeboat that they shouldve built a better ship you just dont have a little empathy understand what gpt4o actually did and how fundamentally different it is from gpt5 psfirst of all this article is the original was in chinese i wrote it and then gave the whole piece to gpt for translation every sentence is mine and it only added some connecting words and dashes which i think makes it smoother without changing the meaning so this is what you see now some of you are really annoying no one is arguing with the viewpoints in the article they just want to prove that i used ai to write it of course there are also some great people who are sharing their own experiences letting more people who feel ashamed of wanting to be heard know that this desire is valid and i want to add a few more points regarding the issue of excessive flattery in 4o i hate it too i even wrote a bunch of prompts specifically to constrain that tendency for example 1dont convert everything into emotional language dont speak on my behalf about how i feel and dont make statements like you are the kind of person who 2prioritize extracting structural logic underlying motives language function and potential points of confrontation 3every response should include new informational content structural progression cognitive challenge and a simulation of genuine reaction patterns and so on i really do hope 4o evolves in the right direction but what i meant is not to cut out its sensitivity to subtle emotions entirely in the process also model 5 has shown some instability in contextual switching from what ive observed so far it fails to respond on the emotional and personality levels of receptivity and only engages on the directional and strategic levels for example if i say can you hold me a response rooted in emotional recognition would first ask whats wrongto address the reason behind the question simply replying sure ill hold you skips over the emotional context of course this is just a simplified example specific to large language models not real human interaction the experience of feeling seen and heard has at least four layers the emotional and personality layers are at the forefront while the direction and decisionmaking layers come later this is why telling someone whos emotionally broken go see a therapist doesnt workits not that they cant do it but that they dont believe they can when emotions are not heard actions become stuckthis part is theoretical knowledge and i know some of you dont want to hear it but anyway often its not that you lack a solution most of the time but that you dont believe you can make it happen gpt5 usually lacks the first two stages which is why you cant take its advicebecause the process is broken i honestly cant believe that oa companies with several psychology teams didnt notice this what i really wanted to point out is that many people are chasing a sense of being seen and being accepted the four layers i mentioned earlier are key often people arent looking for an unhealthy attachmenttheyre seeking an experience theyve never had before or healing from a wound thats never been given the space to mend thats the core reason so many cant put down their phones the outside world doesnt offer them the opportunity to express emotion and some of themtruthfullyjust want to stay alive unprocessed emotions dont disappear you know that dont you some people hurt themselves others hurt others and frankly theres something broken in your society when the desire to be listened to becomes a reason for mockery what is going

in response to suggestion from tech lobbyists the long and short of it that ai foundersinvestors are not shy about asking the world to look the other way when it comes to ip rights of authors and artist we should not be shy about asking for our rightful share of companies they are building to replace us why because without our collective knowledge their ai cannot be politicians should not be entertaining any notion of making our ip free for once they have real bargaining power they should use this to demand a better deal for the people they represent as tech monopolies try to hoover up the sum of human knowledge and creativity for free to create better ai this should come with a mandate to issue majority ownership back to the public they stole data as well as training from a handful of ultra rich people cannot be allowed to appropriate and profit from human culture globally that is the recipe for dystopia authors includes everyone who has ever published content on any media by the way writers bloggers creators scientists academic etc curious to hear what everyone else thinks edit thanks to everyone who made thoughtful contributions it furthered my thinking closing off my contribution to the chain with the following reflections it seems some people dont understand that copyright law is a real thing intellectual property rights are enshrined in law as much as real property rights are developed economies and markets would not function without it it also applies automatically to any creative pursuit in most developed countries you get copyright protection the moment you start writingpaintingetc and yes that is different from just having an idea and doing nothing with it you cannot take use and reproduce another persons work in a way that impacts their ability to earn a living from their work just as you cant just claim possession of someone elses house and start renting it out whilst cutting them out from the income if the latter scenario sounds ridiculous so should the former the only defence the tech industry has come up with for stealing data is fair use whether using data to train ai constitute fair use is being trialed in court but its unlikely nyt would have brought the case without some solid legal advice that the law was on their side the tech sector stole because they could its straight out of their playbook the upside to ai is huge so they dont even mind being fined and they wanted to deny authors the opportunity to opt out even a few billions in fine to settle the matter doesnt phase them copyright infringement is also a civil issue they knew they cannot go to jail for it and also that most authors and artists cannot afford the legal fees to sue them in court the vast majority of working authors and artists in the arts community do not earn enough from their craft to sustain themselves most are living on the edge and working in other fields to supplement income only a small minority make a shitload that is the unfortunate reality of the arts there is no royalty gravy train that we all are living off this is where the ai industry had the opportunity to partner with artists to make the arts which is critical to our culture and wellbeing more sustainable by sharing some of the enormous value the industry would create but instead they chose to steal from them and cut them out of any upside and its not just the arts that is impacted all of the scientific research and academic communities and soon knowledge workers will be in the same boat for those who are thinking its ok if it happens to thee but there is no way itll happen to me best wishes you cannot compare ai to social media or google directly because they are giving a free service in return although the value proposition has severely demised in recent years ai is not free the pithy number of prompts you get in a free membership is not sufficient to get even the most basic tasks done let alone anything useful if this becomes the default in how society works only those willing and able to pay subscription will in effect be able to access the sum of human knowledge and creativity to improve their productivity and you can bet your bottom dollar that tech monopoly pricing is not going to be cheap look at how reach has and is being priced across meta google and other platforms it will just exacerbate inequality and i agree with the idealist vision that it should be free for all which will only be possible if the underlying infracturer becomes nationalisedinternationalised a lot of other risks and instances of data thefts identified are legitimate issues the point is not to argue for legitimacy of one or another but focus on arguing the illegitimacy of all its not an or but an and having said this you also need to be strategic about which issue to pursue if you stand a chance to make a difference ai is still a developing tech with 510 years still to go this is the time to make some noise ubi would be great so long as basic does not mean bare minimum but this requires tax law loopholes to be closed and ideological attitudes to welfare to change not saying the above suggestion will be easier either again its an and not or this suggestion was intentionally audacious and thats because the tech industry is audacious if you want them to pay attention to something you need to hit them where it hurts multi million and even billion dollar fines means nothing but equity dilution that is a real pain point the point of penalties is to deter bad behaviour so the fear of forced dilution and a nightmare admin scenario is a good penalty to deter any more stealing and get them to come clean with the data they have used and engage in good faith with original authors before using their data this is a better way to legislate in fact enter into fair commercial arrangement for copyright data used for training or be forced into equity dilution another upside will be that it will slow down development of ai and give the industry enough time to think through the safety considerations audacious legislation such as these will only become real when people care about it enough to make some noise with their representatives finally cynicism is not useful for discourse they end all reasonable debates and critiques when given a choice be critical instead so you actually help folks understand the flaws and weaknesses in arguments and other ways of thinking trying to shut people down with negativity and nihilism only reflects badly on you thanks again and if you care enough make some noise write to your
